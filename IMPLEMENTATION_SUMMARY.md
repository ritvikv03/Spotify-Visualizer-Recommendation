## 🎓 Learning Algorithms Explained

### 1. Audio DNA Matching
```
Similarity = 1 / (1 + √(Σ wᵢ(xᵢ - yᵢ)²))

Where:
- wᵢ = weight for feature i (energy: 0.20, valence: 0.15, etc.)
- xᵢ = user preference for feature i
- yᵢ = track value for feature i
```

### 2. Feedback Learning
```
newPref = oldPref × (1 - α) + trackValue × α
weight = exp(-age / τ)

Where:
- α = learning rate (0.1)
- τ = time decay constant (50 plays)
```

### 3. Discovery Score
```
score = 100 - popularity + bonuses

Bonuses:
- popularity < 20: +20 (Hidden Gem)
- popularity < 40: +10 (Undiscovered)
- fresh release: +15
```

See **ALGORITHMS.md** for complete explanations.

## 🏆 What Makes This Revolutionary

### 1. Zero Popularity Bias
Unlike Spotify's algorithm, this actively **penalizes** popular tracks and seeks hidden gems.

### 2. Audio-First Matching
Ignores genres and marketing, focuses purely on **sonic characteristics**.

### 3. Explainable AI
Shows users **exactly why** each track was recommended with visual breakdowns.

### 4. Continuous Learning
Improves from **every interaction**: likes, dislikes, plays, skips.

### 5. User Control
**Serendipity slider** lets users control exploration vs exploitation.

### 6. Immersive Visualizations
**14 unique modes** including fractal soundscapes and emotional mapping.

### 7. Persistent Learning
**IndexedDB storage** means the AI remembers across sessions.
