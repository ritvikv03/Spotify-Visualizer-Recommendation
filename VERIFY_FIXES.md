## üîß Steps to See the Changes

### Step 1: Clear All Caches

```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C if running)

# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Clear browser cache (in your browser):
# Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
# Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Cached Web Content
# Safari: Develop ‚Üí Empty Caches
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and Restart

```bash
# Rebuild the project
npm run build

# Start dev server (fresh)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Hard Refresh Browser

After the dev server starts:
- **Chrome/Edge/Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
- **Safari:** `Cmd + Option + R`

### Step 4: Clear Browser Storage

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Clear site data** or manually clear:
   - Local Storage
   - IndexedDB
   - Service Workers

### Step 5: Test the Features

1. **Test Popularity Range:**
   - Look at the "Discovery Filters" card
   - The "Max Popularity" slider should show 0-100%
   - Default should be at 100%

2. **Test Variety:**
   - Click "Analyze My Taste"
   - Note the songs you see
   - Click "Analyze My Taste" again
   - Songs should be **different** and in a **different order**

3. **Test Discovery Scores:**
   - Look at the badges on recommended tracks
   - Scores should range from 0-100
   - Progress bars should fill appropriately

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Verify You're on the Right Branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
# Should show: claude/youtube-music-scraper-011CUT5iTBzyxMN6oXk6q4hw

git log --oneline -1
# Should show: d4b4bca Fix recommendation variety and popularity range issues
```

### Check 2: Verify File Contents

```bash
# Check maxPopularity is 100
grep "maxPopularity: 100" src/components/Discovery/DiscoveryFilters.vue
grep "maxPopularity: 100" src/views/Discover.vue

# Check shuffle code exists
grep "Shuffle to add variety" src/views/Discover.vue
```

### Check 3: Reinstall Dependencies

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Check 4: Check Console for Errors

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any red errors
4. When you click "Analyze", you should see logs like:
   ```
   üéº Using YouTube Music-Inspired Orchestrator...
   üéµ Playability Filter...
   ‚úÖ Strategy: audio-dna, Confidence: 82.3%), 100 unique tracks
   ```

### Check 5: Verify Dev Server Port

- Make sure you're accessing `http://localhost:8888`
- Not any other port
- The dev server must be running

---

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Before (Old):
- ‚ùå Max popularity capped at 50%
- ‚ùå Same songs every time you click "Analyze"
- ‚ùå Progress bars only filled to 50% max

### After (New):
- ‚úÖ Max popularity goes up to 100%
- ‚úÖ Different songs each time you click "Analyze"
- ‚úÖ Progress bars fill from 0-100% correctly
- ‚úÖ More variety (100 tracks fetched instead of 50)

---

## üîç Quick Visual Test

1. **Open the app**
2. **Look at "Discovery Filters"** ‚Üí Max Popularity slider
   - If it shows 50%, old code is running
   - If it shows 100%, new code is running ‚úÖ

3. **Click "Analyze My Taste" twice**
   - If songs are the same, old code is running
   - If songs are different, new code is running ‚úÖ

---

## üí° Common Issues

### Issue: "Max Popularity still shows 50%"
**Solution:** The default is now 100%, but if you had previously used the app, your browser's localStorage might have saved the old 50% value. Clear localStorage in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear All.

### Issue: "Songs are still the same"
**Solution:** Clear IndexedDB in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí IndexedDB ‚Üí Delete all databases, then refresh.

### Issue: "Nothing changed at all"
**Solution:** You might be looking at a cached version. Do a **hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R) and clear all browser data.

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. **Slider shows 100%** when you first load
2. **Different songs** appear each time you analyze
3. **Discovery scores** show values above 50 (like 65, 78, 90)
4. **Console logs** show "100 unique tracks" instead of "50 tracks"

If you've followed all these steps and it's still not working, please share:
1. What you see in the browser console (F12)
2. What the Max Popularity slider shows
3. A screenshot of the discovery filters section
