## 🔍 Verifying Build Artifacts

### Check Build Output in Vercel

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click latest deployment
4. Click **"Building"** or **"Build Logs"** tab
5. Look for:

```
✓ PWA service worker generated
✓ 10 precached entries
files generated
  dist/sw.js
  dist/workbox-28240d0c.js
  dist/manifest.webmanifest
```

### Check Generated Files

The build should create:
- `sw.js` - Service worker file
- `workbox-*.js` - Workbox library for caching
- `manifest.webmanifest` - PWA manifest
- All assets with cache-busting hashes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear cache: DevTools > Application > Clear storage > Clear site data
3. Check HTTPS: Service workers only work on HTTPS (Vercel provides this)
4. Check console for errors

### PWA Install Prompt Not Showing

**Reasons**:
- Already installed
- Not on HTTPS
- Browser doesn't support PWA
- Manifest missing (check DevTools > Application > Manifest)

**Solution**:
1. DevTools > Application > Manifest
2. Verify manifest loaded
3. Check for errors
4. Try different browser

### Export to Spotify Fails

**Check**:
1. Are you logged in?
2. Do you have the required Spotify scopes?
3. Check console for error messages
4. Verify Spotify API credentials in Vercel environment variables

**Common Issue**: OAuth scope
- Need `playlist-modify-public` and `playlist-modify-private` scopes
- May need to re-authenticate

### Analytics Not Showing Data

**Wait Time**: Analytics can take 24-48 hours to show data

**Check**:
1. Vercel plan supports analytics (free tier has limits)
2. Site has actual traffic
3. Ad blockers might prevent tracking (expected)

### Images Not Lazy Loading

**Check**:
1. Browser supports `loading="lazy"` (all modern browsers do)
2. Images are below the fold (lazy loading only affects off-screen images)
3. DevTools > Network > Slow 3G to see effect more clearly
