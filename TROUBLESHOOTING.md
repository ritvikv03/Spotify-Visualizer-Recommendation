# Troubleshooting Guide

## üîí 403 Forbidden Error - "Access Denied"

If you see a **403 error** when trying to use the Analyze function, this means your Spotify account is not approved to use this app.

### Why This Happens

This app is currently in **Development Mode**, which means only users manually added to an "allowlist" can use it. Spotify limits development mode apps to 25 approved users for security reasons.

### Solution: Add Your Account to the Allowlist

#### For App Developers:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Select your application (the one with Client ID: `192b8dcaf7a74066954f116e0ef4252a`)
4. Navigate to the **"Users and Access"** tab
5. Click **"Add User"**
6. Enter the Spotify account email or username you want to approve
7. Click **"Save"**
8. The user can now log in and use the app!

#### For Users:

Ask the app developer to add your Spotify account to the allowlist. Provide them with:
- Your Spotify email address, OR
- Your Spotify username

Once added, you'll need to:
1. Log out of the app
2. Clear your browser cache (or use incognito mode)
3. Log in again

The app should now work!

## üéµ "Spotify Recommendations endpoint is no longer available"

### What Happened?

On **November 27, 2024**, Spotify deprecated several API endpoints including:
- `/recommendations` - Get track recommendations
- `/audio-features` - Get audio features (energy, danceability, etc.)
- `/audio-analysis` - Get detailed audio analysis

These endpoints are **no longer available** for apps in Development Mode.

### Our Solution

This app now uses a **custom recommendation algorithm** that:
- Analyzes your listening history (top tracks, artists, genres)
- Finds "hidden gems" from your own library
- Scores tracks based on popularity, genre match, and artist diversity
- Recommends tracks you already have but might have forgotten about!

**This fallback algorithm activates automatically** if the Spotify recommendations endpoint returns a 403 error.

## üö´ Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: "No music data found! Play 5-10 songs on Spotify first."

**Cause:** Your Spotify account doesn't have enough listening history.

**Solution:**
1. Open Spotify and play at least 5-10 different songs
2. Wait a few minutes for Spotify to process your listening history
3. Try the Analyze function again

---

### Error: "Token expired" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Cause:** Your access token has expired.

**Solution:** The app should automatically refresh your token. If it doesn't:
1. Log out
2. Log back in
3. Try again

---

### Error: "User not registered in the developer dashboard"

**Cause:** You're trying to use an account that hasn't been added to the allowlist.

**Solution:** See the "Add Your Account to the Allowlist" section above.
